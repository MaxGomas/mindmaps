## 🎯 Getting Started

### Local Development
For the best experience, use a local server to avoid CORS issues:

```bash
# Python (Recommended)
cd path/to/SC300mm
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000

# Node.js alternative
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000

# VS Code Live Server
# Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

### Basic Usage
1. **Open the application**: Access via local server or GitHub Pages
2. **Select a mindmap**: Use the dropdown to switch between mindmaps
3. **Explore**: Click on color-coded +/- buttons to expand nodes
4. **Navigate**: Use mouse wheel to zoom, drag to pan
5. **Learn**: Click on nodes to see rich information in the side panel
6. **Refresh**: Use the refresh button to reload mindmaps after editing JSON files

## ✨ Adding New Mindmaps

Adding a new mindmap is incredibly simple:

### Method 1: Using index.json (Recommended)
1. Create your mindmap JSON file in the `mindmaps/` folder
2. Add the filename to `mindmaps/index.json`
3. Refresh the page - your mindmap will appear automatically!

### Method 2: Auto-discovery
1. Just add your JSON file to the `mindmaps/` folder
2. The system will automatically try to load known file patterns

### Example: Adding a "Project Management" mindmap

1. **Create the file**: `mindmaps/project-management.json`
```json
{
  "title": "Project Management",
  "name": "Project Management",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Planning",
      "description": "Project planning phase",
      "details": "Detailed planning is crucial for project success",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "Scope Definition",
          "description": "Define project boundaries",
          "details": "Clearly define what is and isn't included in the project"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Update index.json**:
```json
{
  "files": [
    "technology-trends.json",
    "learning-path.json", 
    "business-strategy.json",
    "personal-development.json",
    "project-management.json"
  ]
}
```

3. **Refresh** - Done! 🎉

## 📋 JSON Structure

Each mindmap follows this structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Display Name in Dropdown",
  "name": "Root Node Name", 
  "description": "Optional brief description",
  "details": "Optional detailed information",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Child Node Name",
      "description": "Optional description", 
      "details": "Optional detailed info",
      "children": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Required Fields
- `name`: Node display name
- `title` OR `name`: Root level title

### Optional Fields  
- `description`: Brief tooltip description
- `details`: Detailed information for info panel
- `children`: Array of child nodes

## 🎮 Controls

- **Dropdown**: Select different mindmaps with live switching
- **Refresh Button**: Reload mindmaps after editing JSON files (with cache-busting)
- **Reset View**: Center and reset zoom level with smooth animation

## 📝 Tips for Creating Great Mindmaps

1. **Keep node names concise** (15-25 characters work best for readability)
2. **Use descriptions for quick context** (appears in info panel)
3. **Add detailed information for learning** (rich content in side panel)
4. **Organize hierarchically** (3-4 levels deep is optimal for navigation)
5. **Use consistent terminology** across related nodes
6. **Test your JSON** for valid structure before adding to index.json
7. **Consider visual balance** when designing node layouts
8. **Use meaningful titles** for dropdown clarity

## 🛠️ Development & Debugging

### Common Issues
- **"No mindmaps found"**: Use a local server (see LOCAL_SERVER_SETUP.md)
- **JSON not loading**: Check console for syntax errors
- **Links not visible**: Ensure proper node hierarchy and naming
- **Performance issues**: Limit to ~500 nodes per mindmap

### Debugging Tools
- Browser console shows detailed loading information
- Network tab shows JSON fetch requests
- Use refresh button to test changes immediately
- Cache-busting ensures latest file versions are loaded
